# Context

Vocabulary for pokerogue-mcp. Glossary only — no implementation detail.

## Run

One playthrough of PokéRogue, from wave 1 until the party wipes. A **wipe** ends the run; the next run starts again at wave 1 with nothing carried over except account-level unlocks. A run is the unit the agent plays.

## Wave

One encounter within a run — a battle, or a between-battle screen such as a shop or reward choice. Waves are numbered from 1 and never repeat within a run.

## Party

The pokémon the player controls in the current run. The **active pokémon** is the one currently on the field; the rest are on the bench. Distinct from account-level collection data.

## Settled

The state of the game when it is waiting for player input: no animation playing, no phase resolving, no message auto-advancing. Reading state or sending a press while **unsettled** races the game's own queue. Every tool call returns a settled game.

## Snapshot

The structured, text-only view of the game at a settled moment. **Lean** by default (wave, biome, money, active pokémon, enemy, current menu); detail is pulled on demand. A snapshot is read from the live game, never computed or simulated.

## Menu

Whatever the game is currently asking the player to choose between. Identified by its **UiMode** (an int from the game's own enum) and served by a **handler** — the game object that owns the menu's options and cursor. A menu is **known** when the server can read its labels and move its cursor, and **unknown** otherwise; unknown menus degrade to raw presses rather than blocking.

## Button

One of the game's own input actions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, ACTION, CANCEL, MENU, …), identified by an int from the game's `Button` enum. A **press** delivers exactly one button to the game.

## Escape ladder

For a given menu, the ordered **rungs** that leave it, safest first. Each rung is a press, a pick among options not yet tried, a wait, or, last of all, a page **reload**. Each carries a risk: **safe** (nothing lost), **lossy** (gives up an in-run choice such as a reward, a move or an evolution) or **destructive** (loses something lasting: a team member, a save slot, saved preferences, or progress since the last save). A **must-answer** menu is one the game won't release until an option is chosen, so backing out is the wrong move. A **no-escape** menu can't be left by any input at all. The ladder is only offered for the game version it was reviewed against.

## Option

A single selectable entry in a menu, with a visible **label**. Selecting an option by label is a decision; the cursor movement it takes is an implementation detail the server hides.
