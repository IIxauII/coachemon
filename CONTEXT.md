# Context

Vocabulary for pokerogue-mcp. Glossary only — no implementation detail.

## Run

One playthrough of PokéRogue, from wave 1 until the party wipes. A **wipe** ends the run; the next run starts again at wave 1 with nothing carried over except account-level unlocks. A run is the unit the agent plays.

## Wave

One encounter within a run — a battle, or a between-battle screen such as a shop or reward choice. Waves are numbered from 1 and never repeat within a run.

## Party

The pokémon the player controls in the current run. The **active pokémon** is the one currently on the field; the rest are on the bench. Distinct from account-level collection data.

## Settled

The state of the game when it is waiting for player input: no animation playing, no phase resolving, no message auto-advancing. Reading state or sending a press while **unsettled** races the game's own queue. Every tool call returns a settled game.

## Snapshot

The structured, text-only view of the game at a settled moment. **Lean** by default (wave, biome, money, active pokémon, enemy, current menu); detail is pulled on demand. A snapshot is read from the live game, never computed or simulated.

## Menu

Whatever the game is currently asking the player to choose between. Presented by a **screen**, and served by a **handler** — the game object that owns the menu's options and cursor. A menu is **known** when the server can read its labels and move its cursor, and **unknown** otherwise; unknown menus degrade to raw presses rather than blocking.

## Button

One of the game's own input actions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, ACTION, CANCEL, MENU, …), identified by an int from the game's `Button` enum. A **press** delivers exactly one button to the game.

## Option

A single selectable entry in a menu, with a visible **label**. Selecting an option by label is a decision; the cursor movement it takes is an implementation detail the server hides.

## Screen

What the game is actually asking, as a whole. A screen is *not* the same as a **UiMode**: one UiMode can serve several screens that differ in what they mean and in how they can be left, so a screen is identified by the UiMode together with whatever discriminates it. The **menu** is the choice a screen presents; the screen is the thing Claude is looking at.

## Interrupted run

A run that ended without the party wiping — the game tore itself down and dropped back to the title. Distinct from a **wipe**: a wipe is an ending the agent played its way into, while an interrupted run is a failure, and the run may still exist server-side. The two are never reported as the same thing, because treating an interruption as a wipe invites starting a new run over a run that is still alive.
